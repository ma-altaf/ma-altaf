I prefer learning new technologies and concepts by doing projects rather than learning from only watching tutorials or doing courses, since most of the time I forget the things I learn while doing tutorials/courses. When doing projects on the other hand, I donâ€™t just find myself remembering more but I also get the confidence that I can figure my way through the documentations to solve real problems. 

Bonus: it is more fun to plan, design and code something unique rather than just repeating step by step the contents of tutorials.
